# Weather Dashboard - Challenge 6

## USER STORY:

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Description  
The Weather Dashboard application utilizes third-party APIs and will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, to display current and future weather conditions for a 5-day forecast, in real-time.
## Built With  
This site was developed using the following technologies:  
* HTML (HyperText Markup Language)  
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  
* JS (JavaScript)  
* jQuery
* APIs
## Directions for Future Development  
* There will be a function that utilizes the user input for city searches to dynamically create a search history below the search bar
* A function that converts the temperature from it's default, in Kelvin, to Fahrenheit
* A function that converts the icon codes into corresponding icons for differnet types of weather
* An edit to the sidenav to make it responsive to the scale of the viewport, as with the rest of the app
